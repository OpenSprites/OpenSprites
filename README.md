# OpenSprites
Welcome to the main OpenSprites development repository. Inspired by Scratch Resources, OpenSprites is a new sharing platform designed for Scratchers to upload their own content, as well as download other's content for free use in their projects. It is being developed open-source by a small group of collaborating Scratchers. The code is available on GitHub.

For more information, please visit the discussion thread: http://scratch.mit.edu/discuss/topic/85320/ The site shall be hosted here: http://opensprites.x10.mx/ If you want to see our progress so far, our live alpha testing site is here: http://dev.opensprites.x10.mx/ If you have any questions, don't hesitate to use our new forums: http://opensprites.x10.mx/forums/. Thank you to cauzality who kindly made our logos and various graphical mockups!
