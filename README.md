# OpenSprites
Welcome to the main OpenSprites development repository. Inspired by Scratch Resources, OpenSprites is a new sharing platform designed for Scratchers to upload their own content, as well as download other's content for free use in their projects. It is being developed open-source by a small group of collaborating Scratchers. The code is available on GitHub.

For more information, please visit the discussion thread: scratch.mit.edu/discuss/topic/85320/ The site shall be hosted here: http://opensprites.x10.mx/
