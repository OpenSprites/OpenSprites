###What does OpenSprites know about me?
####The stuff you tell us...
When you make an account on our site, you give us some basic information so we can set up your account. We require the username of your Scratch account, a new password, and your email address. We need your email address to send password resets and confirm your account. We promise never to sell, rent or tell anyone your email unless forced to do so by law.
