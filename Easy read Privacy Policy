###What does OpenSprites know about me?
####The stuff you tell us...
When you make an account on our site, we need some basic information so we can set up your account. We require the username of your Scratch account, a new password, and your email address. We need your email address to send password resets and confirm your account. We promise never to sell, rent or tell anyone your email unless forced to do so by law. When you upload something to our site, we remember the original name of the file, and who uploaded it. This is so other users can search for your file quickly. We don't collect any details about your computer, either.
####The stuff your computer tells us automatically...
When you connect to any website, anywhere on the web, your computer will aways send a unique number to the computer you are connecting to. This number is called an Internet Protocol Address, but everyone calles it an IP because it's less of a mouthful. We use this unique number to identify you across the site so our computers still know that you are the user we think you are. We also use these numbers to blacklist users who severly break our Community Rules so we can keep the site safe and happy.
