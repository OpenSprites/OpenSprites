		Since the Winter holidays, the OpenSprites Team has been working hard to add new features, squash bugs, and get the basic site working.
		Here is what we've done so far:
			* Migrated over to Gwiddle for better performance, flexibility, and stability.
			* Set up the EsoTalk forums running with our colour theme, along with our registration and user verification system.
			* Set up our own secure upload system working using MySQL.
			* Media 'profiles' display a link for users to directly link to uploaded images so they can use them in forums.
			* Image preview thumbnails successfully render for sound, scripts and images.
			* Fixed major bug with sessions after updates.
			* We now have a fully working blog that uses markdown.
			* We have enabled our OpenSprites guidelines, privacy policy, and terms of service.
			
		Stay tuned for more updates!
