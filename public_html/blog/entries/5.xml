    We are happy to announce that OpenSprites now has it's very own domain name! From now onwards, the OpenSprites             website shall be hosted on the new web-address, and we expect to see some major changes go underway within the new          few weeks.
    
    You can expect:
    * Faster Read-Write speeds on our servers.
    * A CDN service to speed up downloading and to decrease pressure on OpenSprites.
    * Faster site development with new team software to organize the team better.
    * Emails for each developer and support email line.
    * JIRA help desk support system to better aid users.
    * Copyright Infringement report catagory on help desk.
