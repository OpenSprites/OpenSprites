    <blogheader>Migration Complete!</blogheader>
    <blogcontents>
		The migration to the (main site)[http://opensprites.gwiddle.co.uk] is now complete.
		This means that this blog, if you've noticed, has moved over to */blog/* instead of being on a subdomain.
		
		So it's now much easier for people like me to update the site!
