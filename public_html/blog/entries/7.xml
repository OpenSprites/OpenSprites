    <blogcontents>
        October the 31st is on its way, and that only means one thing; halloween! We've decided to add a new halloween style theme, by DM5555, to the theme selection box at the bottom of every page. However, if feeling cosy on cold days is more of your cup of tea, we've got that covered too. The warm theme, courtesy of Arinerron, is the second of these two new themes to be added to the site. To use these themes, simply click the dropdown at the bottom of the page to select a theme: Regular, Dark, Halloween or Warm. These themes will also be added to the forums in the near future. Enjoy!

        EDIT: The new themes do not work in Firefox browsers. However they work in Chrome, MS Edge and Internet Explorer(11)
