    <blogheader>Moving over to our main domain</blogheader>
    <blogcontents>
        You may have already noticed that instead of the plain old 'Whoops' page on our main domain, we have replaced it
        with the OpenSprites site. To make it easier for us to get things working, we need everything on the same web
        address; we've decided to start migrating the website from our developer domain to our main one. At the moment,
        we have not fully completed the migration, and some small issues may occur. Also, be aware that the main domain
        won't be updated as often as the developer domain, so you may experience problems. For this reason, please use
        the developer domain until we have completed this transition. Thanks! **cheeseeater**
