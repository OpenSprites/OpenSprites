    <blogheader>Searching the Site!</blogheader>
    <blogcontents>
    You can now search the site with our fancy custom search tool at the top of the page. Just type in a keyword or two for what you're looking for, and it should come up _while you are typing!_
    
    For example, you could type in Bob the Cactus and it will bring up all the uploads of our lovely cactus, Bob (of whom you should know - Bob is getting his picture taken once every month to see him as he grows).
    
    You can also click on **See all results + Search options** to make a more customized search result to get what you're looking for in a shorter amount of time. It'll also show all the results, in case the thing you're looking for has a whole bunch of results!
