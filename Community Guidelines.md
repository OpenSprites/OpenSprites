###Community Guidelines
In order to keep OpenSprites safe and friendly for everyone, we ask you to follow our Community Guidelines. Our Guidelines are based around the Scratch Community 
Guidelines, which also apply on OpenSprites.

* Be respectful. When sharing projects or posting comments, remember that people of many different ages and backgrounds will see what you’ve shared.
* Be constructive. When commenting about others' media, say something you like about it and offer suggestions.
* Don't copy. Don't download somebody else's media and re-upload it as your own. Don't upload media that you didn't make unless it is open-source and you give proper credit.
* Keep personal info private. For safety reasons, don't use full names or post contact info like phone numbers or addresses.
* Be honest. Don’t try to impersonate other Scratchers, spread rumours, or otherwise try to trick the community.
* Help keep the site friendly. If you think somebody's media or comment is mean, insulting, too violent, or otherwise inappropriate, click “Report” to let us know about it.
* We welcome people of all ages, races, ethnicities, religions, sexual orientations, and gender identities.

If you break any of our Community Guidelines, the OpenSprites staff will take appropriate action. If you see anybody break these Guidelines, press "Report" and we will deal with the problem.
