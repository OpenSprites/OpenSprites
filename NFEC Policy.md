purchased  #What is NFE content?
Not For Everyone Content (NFEC) is content that could potentially be pushing the OpenSprites Guidelines boundary. OpenSprites has a very strict set of regulations concerning what NFEC is and how accessible it is to other users. To clarify, Scratch allows the sharing of NFE projects.

###What does OpenSprites define NFEC as?
* Content exhibiting blood with the limit of the size of a paper-cut or small scratch wound. **Must not** be a realistic cartoon or be a photograph.

* Content exhibiting graphic violence, such as hitting, punching and kicking or any other form of malicious contact. Visible wounds are not permitted.

* Content explaining or referring to controversial subjects or issues, bias or unbiased.

* Content explaining or referring to subjects or issues which children may not fully understand. Please be aware that some parents may wish to explain issues of this type to their children privately.

* Content exhibiting verbal abuse.
