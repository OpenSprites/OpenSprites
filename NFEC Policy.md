### What is NFEC? ###

Not For Everyone Content (NFEC) is content that could potentially be pushing the OpenSprites Guidelines boundary. OpenSprites has a strict set of regulations concerning what NFEC is and how accessible it is to other users. To clarify, Scratch allows the sharing of Not For Everyone projects.

### What does OpenSprites define NFEC as? ##

* Content exhibiting blood with the limit of the size of a paper-cut or small scratch wound. **Must not** be a realistic cartoon or be a photograph.
* Content exhibiting graphic violence, such as hitting, punching and kicking or any other form of malicious contact. Visible wounds are not permitted.
* Content explaining or referring to certain controversial subjects or issues, bias or unbiased.
* Content explaining or referring to subjects or issues which children may not fully understand. Please be aware that some parents may wish to explain issues of this type to their children privately.
* Content exhibiting verbal abuse.
* Content depicting intoxication positively.

### How does OpenSprites handle NFEC? ###

OpenSprites handles NFEC similarly to Scratch. NFEC **is allowed** on the site, but with the following restrictions:

* NFEC listed content is disallowed from showing on the front page or on the resource pages under the browse menu.
* Staff are disallowed to link to NFEC publically.
* Post on the forums which link to NFE content are generally disallowed.
* Comments on non-NFEC content which link to NFEC are generally disallowed.

OpenSprites moderators reserve the right to deal with NFEC policy violations at their own discretion, depending on the severity.
