	Welcome to the all new OpenSprites Blog!
	
	First of all, special thanks to Liam4 for this clever, tweak-able blog! 
	
	Every week, we will be releasing news, information and updates on the development of OpenSprites.
	Within this last week, we have welcomed Gwiddle owner ZeusKing19 (aka jbayfield) to our team, migrated Gwiddle accounts, requested a license for JIRA 
	and almost permanently messed up the forums. Luckily almost everything was resolved.
