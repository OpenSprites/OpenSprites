    <blogheader>Why use this blog?</blogheader>
    <blogcontents>

Why use this blog, you might wonder. I actually have quite a few reasons:

1. It uses [Markdown](https://github.com/chjj/marked). This means that you can easily put in formatting without having to worry about any tags.
2. It's built in PHP and JavaScript. That means you don't have to worry about setting up a database, all you'll need is an entries folder to keep your blog posts in!
3. It's got themes. There's quite a number of themes, actually - custom colors, backgrounds or even different layouts can all be made with the (simple!) themes.
4. It's well organized. You put your entries in the [entries](entries/index.php) folder, your themes in the [themes](themes/index.php) folder, and done! Whenever you make a new post and save it in entries, they'll appear at the [index](index.php).

The only real catch is that since it's run on files put in to the entries folder, you have to update your site (or the entries folder of your site) every time you want to publish a post. It also means that since it uses PHP and JavaScript to run, with no SQL, there's no ability to get comments. Perhaps we could get e-mails such as `liam4@blog.opensprites.x10.mx` (and later `liam4@blog.opensprites.org`)?
